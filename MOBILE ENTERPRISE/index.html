      <h2>Welcome to My Profile</h2>
      <p>Watching anime, for me, is about soaking in the experience, not rushing through it.
      I prefer to watch just one episode a day. That slow pace really lets me connect with the characters and the world.
      I want the anime's openings and endings to get stuck in my head and feel the true passage of time with the story—it makes
      the whole journey feel more meaningful than just quickly moving on to the next thing.</p>

            <li>Fragrant Flowers Blooms With Dignity - 7.6/10 <br><br>

A deeply wholesome and charming romance, which focuses on the intimate beauty of genuine connection. <br>
It's broken people finding and bonding with one another to facilitate mutual healing. <br>
Through their simple yet radical acts ofseeing past the other's external defenses to the kindness and<br>
vulnerability underneath.This story is about overcoming deeply personal insecurities and prejudices, <br>
ultimately showing how true love and acceptance can help people embrace their true selves.<br>

            <li>City the Animation - 9/10<br><br>

So back when I was a kid I've learned of this word called "sonder" it's that every person around you <br>
has a life as complex and vivid as your own, with their own dreams, worries, and stories.<br>
Ever since then I've dreamed to write a story that encapsulates this feeling and this show is the closest<br>
thing to this feeling<br>

<img src="C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\MOBILE ENTERPRISE\City_volume_1_cover.jpg" alt="Evermore Album"></li>
            <li>The Summer Hikaru Died - 10/10 <br><br>

Everyday I wake up being grateful that I was alive to watch this show weekly. I'm just mind blown every<br>
time I watch it, like I can't believe a genius was able to create something like this.<br>

            <li>Anne Shirley - 8/10 <br><br>

I’ve always thought of Anne of Green Gables as “baby’s first peak fiction,” and I mean that in the most <br>
loving way possible. Growing up with Anne’s story, I learned how she navigated life: from being a neglected <br>
child, to a cheerful friend, to a daughter who sometimes messes up but whose intentions are always good. We mourn<br>
with her through the loss of a loved one, follow her from being a teenager into adulthood, and watch her balance a<br>
burgeoning career with finding true love. This story has so much to offer an impressionable person, like myself, <br>
seeking guidance. Anne’s journey is so relatable that you are bound to be emotionally touched by how deeply her <br>
stories can affect you. The new adaptation certainly does justice in conveying these tales. I’ll admit that if a <br>
person who had never heard of Anne’s story watched this as their first adaptation (like I was at one point), they<br>
would likely enjoy it very much. But that is where it stops—it merely does justice; it is far from the best <br>
adaptation of Anne’s story.<br>

            <li>The Apothecary Diaries S2 - 8.3/10 <br><br>

This has been the greatest cour so far. It is the culmination of all the setup from the previous cours. It's just<br>
a delight to watch it play out. Compared to the other cours there's a solid storyline instead of following Mao Mao<br>
solve mysteries. Apothecary Diaries change genres in this season from mainly mystery to historical drama and I am on<br>
the edge of my seat watching it.<br>

<img src="C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\MOBILE ENTERPRISE\the-apothecary-diaries.avif"</li>

<li>Takopi's Original Sin - 7.2/10 <br><br>


It dipped its toes in the water, but never really fully emerged from it. It presented a lot of great themes but never<br>
really interested in tackling it and it kinda tricked a lot of people into thinking it's deeper than it actually is.<br>

<img src="C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\MOBILE ENTERPRISE\8ec7c3993756d6aaa7f13ecf2d9c7c98.webp"</li>

<li>Solo Leveling S2 - 7.4/10 <br><br>


This anime asks the question, what if the self-insert power fantasy anime, is pretty solid? It solves one of my main<br>
gripes with these kinds of stories, they actually take the time to show the MC training and the second season is the <br>
fruit of that seed.<br>

<img src="C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\MOBILE ENTERPRISE\2b6d2aa7-eb43-40d0-b6ca-9688e7f3bb21.webp"</li>

<li>Orb: On the Movements of the Earth - 10/10 <br><br>


I absolutely love Orb! The characters obsession with research to the point that they would risk their lives, you can't<br>
help but root for them. What sets it apart is the high-stakes tension; even small errors can have devastating results<br>
largely because the antagonist is so compelling and they have maintained this for a 25 episode stretch, which makes the<br> 
entire show so captivating, even if it was just characters presenting their thesis on the pursuit of truth.<br>
There are still a few action set pieces here and there but the highlight of the show are characters pondering. At Chapter 3<br>
or the final part of the series, majority of the scenes are just the characters talking, questioning and debating on what the<br>
truth is. <br>
